import throttle from './throttle';

/**
 * Debounce execution of a function. Debouncing, unlike throttling,
 * guarantees that a function is only executed a single time, either at the
 * very beginning of a series of calls, or at the very end.
 *
 * @param  {number}   delay -         A zero-or-greater delay in milliseconds. For event callbacks, values around 100 or 250 (or even higher) are most useful.
 * @param  {boolean}  [atBegin] -     Optional, defaults to false. If atBegin is false or unspecified, callback will only be executed `delay` milliseconds
 *                                  after the last debounced-function call. If atBegin is true, callback will be executed only at the first debounced-function call.
 *                                  (After the throttled-function has not been called for `delay` milliseconds, the internal counter is reset).
 * @param  {Function} callback -      A function to be executed after delay milliseconds. The `this` context and all arguments are passed through, as-is,
 *                                  to `callback` when the debounced-function is executed.
 *
 * @returns {Function} A new, debounced function.
